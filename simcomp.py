Program name: Similar Compactor

Function of the program:

The program aims to compress large files or a large amount of data. The program's paradigm is: the file may be larger than the computer's capacity to store it, but the file will still be stored on the computer with the greatest possible compression. Unlike other programs, this program makes cascading compressions in order to compress files by their bit similarities, that is, the intersection of bits will avoid unnecessary data repetition. This is what differentiates this program from others that apparently have the same function.
